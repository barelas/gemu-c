This is a simulator for a Grid system writen in C. It allows simulation of a workload to a distributed system, and comparison of different scheduling algoriths.

It was built at 2003 for my [diploma thesis](http://students.ceid.upatras.gr/~barelas/proptyxiakh-diplwmatikh-ergasia-barelas.pdf) on Grid scheduling algorithms.

It is really outdated. I think it can only serve as an educational tool on C programming.

If you want to experiment with a more sophisticated grid system simulator, you may like [gemu](https://github.com/barelas/gemu).
